# Data Science

## data science pipeline

### Data collection and processing

Ingest data from unstructured and structured sources, and use relational models, time series algorithms, graph and network processing, natural language processing, geographic information system processes to store and manage the data.

- Data collection and scraping
- Relational data
- Graph and network processing
- Free text and natural language processing

### Statistical modeling

Apply basic statistical techniques and analyses to understand properties of the data and to design experimental setups for testing hypotheses or collecting new data.

- Linear regression
- Linear classification
- Overfitting, generalization, and cross validation
- Regularization - a way to control model complexity: keep the weights small
- Nonlinear modeling
- Kernels(Polynomial Kernel, RBF Kernel)
- Maxiumum likelihood estimation
- Naive Bayes
- Hypothesis testing and experimental design

### Advanced ML techniques

Apply advanced machine learning algorithms such as kernel methods, boosting, deep learning, anomaly detection, factorization models, and probabilistic modeling to analyze and extract insights from data.

- Clustering and dimensionality reduction
- Recommender systems
- Anomaly detection
- Decision trees, interpretable models
- Deep learning

### Data visualization

Visualize the data and results from analysis, particularly focusing on visualizing and understanding high-dimensional structured data and the results of statistical and machine learning analysis.

- Data exploration visualization: figuring out what is true
- Data presentation visualization: convincing other people it is true
- Data types:
  - Nominal: categorical data, no ordering
  - Ordinal: categorical data, with ordering
  - Interval: numerical data, zero has no fixed meaning  
  - Ratio: numerical data, zero has special meaning

### Big data

Scale the methods to big data regimes, where distributed storage and computation are needed to fully realize capabilities of data analysis techniques.

- MapReduce

### Data science debugging

Learn to diagnose problems with data science pipelines, finding problems in data collection, problem setup, machine learning models, and conclusions.
